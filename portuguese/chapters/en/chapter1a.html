<h1>Verbs</h1>
<h2>"ir" as an auxiliary verb</h2>
<p>The verb "ir" is widely used in informal speech as an auxiliary verb and can replace the regular conjugation of verbs.</p>
<div class="callout">
    <p><b>Eu vou te ligar.</b><i> (I will call you)</i></p></p>
</div>
<p>Notice that we donâ€™t say "Eu te ligarei." This substitution is extremely common.</p>
