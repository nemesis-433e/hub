<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
<h2>About</h2>
<p>First, I'm not a linguist and I have no formal degree in the subject. I'm just an enthusiast with a general interest in languages. </p>
<p>This guide was first design to help a person that was struggling to find good Portuguese guides on the internet. But I just thought it would be a great idea to open to public and help the most people I can.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>This is not Portuguese guide for beginners. It’s expected prior knowledge from the reader.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I can’t recommend any specific guides for beginners, as I’m not familiar with any.</p>

<h2>Format</h2>
<p>I’ll try to keep the explanations as concise as possible while providing a good amount of practical examples, since I believe that examples and context are the best way to get a grasp on grammar and vocabulary.</p>
